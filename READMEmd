# Traveler's Weather Dashboard

As a traveler, knowing the weather of my destination is important to planning and packing for my trip accordingly. This Traveler's Weather Dashboard is a web-app for checking the current weather and 5-day forecast for a destination city.

### About

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge here is to build a weather dashboard that will:
- Run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- F*eature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
